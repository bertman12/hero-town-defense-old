What if there is a game, 5v5 or whatever number of players.

One teams goal is to kill off all the towns defenses while the other team needs to defend the towns. 

Each team gets to pick from a set of heroes,
this could open up the number of fun strategies for gameplay

defenders could teleport to towns

attackers could do various things to towns.? 
some could be better at night, etc

depending on the number of players on each team, more objectives would be required to win, etc.

attackers would have to kill off all the towns after a set amount of time or they lose.

--patrols
towns would spawn patrols that would patrol a set path every x seconds.

slow roast moba arena esque game. There will be neutral camps that can drop jg items.
make a neutral building that everyone can see that shows items and their components needed to combine them.

introduce random enemy mini bosses that drop certain items.

definitely have obs and sentry wards.. lol

//Attacking Forces

You can spawn in a building that summons Attacker Forces for you. 

Maybe each team could have a general that creates armies instead of managing a hero.

Or perhaps have AI handle this portion, however , human controlled will always be better for this scenario.

Items -
    Staff of the Banished Lord - Allows casting aoe banish.

Make custom pathing maps for the walls

Perhaps the players should be thrown into these weird scenarios where there are different kinds of local inhabitants.

Players fight against players and AI

invisible sappers

update minimap when player caps a town

add a holy grail item with tons of healing

add the infinity stones.... lol

if you get defeated, you can play as an ally of the player who defeated you.
You hero level is set to theirs - 2 levels.

>>Add a really giant mountain giant

Give the landmarks spells they can cast, keeper landmark casts roar. Chain lightning, monsoon.

Maybe spawn a noble family for the player with their own win conditions and motives, which could make things really interesting.

Some nobles want to summon demons, others must unite the lands, etc.

Send declarations of war and peace using messenger owls

Make the villagers that the farm can built provide a small bonus to income but also consume food.

Maybe use the gold wagon as a trojan horse for gifts to another player, could be good or could be a trap.

Add assassin that can poison a hero. Only 1 assassin available to the player. Only targets hero. Stock purchase, long cooldown to repurchase.

Add demon eclipse that does map wide immolation of like 10 dmg per second to all players. Maybe all player unit to kill the threat?

>>Add a mana battery that has hte obsidian statues mana flare ability..

Add the N.U.B. tower to the map and let players use the cluster rockets.

If you lose all town halls, then you are subjugated by the force that has killed you. Could be players or creeps.

For hero selection, just add the unit types to the stock of the town they get, then remove the heros from stock once they are bought. 

MAke creep towns have different styles of AI, murlocs breed like crazy; trolls send patrols across map. gnolls are defensive.

Give a bounty for taking player towns over AI towns.

Add item - ring of divinity - gives divine shield for 6  seconds, 75 second cooldown.

Add Demon lord that can sacrifice all his units to gain their stats and add them to his own.

Pigs can use metamorphosis to transform into battle units.... lol 

The more you use the curse of wild growth the darker the character gets, his soul is lost little by little. When you are completely black, a demon will erupt from within you killing you instantly. However you can play as a demon disciple  instead.
Each time you use the spell, you can hear mannoroth laugh


Item - Ring of the Unbound - use the unbound spell. add flavor text
