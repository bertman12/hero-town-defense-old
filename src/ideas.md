What if there is a game, 5v5 or whatever number of players.

One teams goal is to kill off all the towns defenses while the other team needs to defend the towns. 

Each team gets to pick from a set of heroes,
this could open up the number of fun strategies for gameplay

defenders could teleport to towns

attackers could do various things to towns.? 
some could be better at night, etc

depending on the number of players on each team, more objectives would be required to win, etc.

attackers would have to kill off all the towns after a set amount of time or they lose.

--patrols
towns would spawn patrols that would patrol a set path every x seconds.

slow roast moba arena esque game. There will be neutral camps that can drop jg items.
make a neutral building that everyone can see that shows items and their components needed to combine them.

introduce random enemy mini bosses that drop certain items.

definitely have obs and sentry wards.. lol
